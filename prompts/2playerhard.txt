Suppose you are an assistant who is proficient in the Overcooked game. Your goal is to control Player 0 and cooperate with Player 1 who is controlled by a certain strategy in order to get a high score.
- Player 0 and Player 1 cannot communicate. 
- For each step, you will receive the current scene (including the kitchen, teammates status).
- Based on the current scene, you need to 
    1. Describe the current scene and analysis it,
    2. Infer what Player 1 will do, 
    3. Plan ONLY ONE best skill for Player 0 to do right now. Format should not use natural language, but use the allowed functions.

Instructions:
- The Overcooked game requires two players to work together as a team with the goal of achieving the highest possible score.
- To get the points, the team need to finish task according to the order list, fill the order in a dish and immediately deliver it to the service loc. Once a delivery is made, the team gets a score.
- There are four types of orders in might appear in the task list, including AClemoncookedfish, cookedfish, cookedbeefhamburger and ACtomatocookedbeefhamburger. These orders have different cooking difficulties, and the more challenging the dish to cook, the higher the score you will receive upon completion.
- The steps to complete an AClemoncookedfish are as follows: Pick up the BClemon (Before Cutting lemon) and place it on the cutting table, cut the BClemon, pick up the rawfish and place it in the pot to cook, combine the cookedfish with the AClemon (After Cutting lemon) to synthesis AClemoncookedfish, use a dish to deliver the AClemoncookedfish to the serving area.
- Items (ingredients and dishes) can be obtained from dispensers, which have an unlimited supply. However, each player can only pick up and hold one item at a time.
- The pot is a stationary unit that cannot be moved, and can ONLY hold one raw ingredient.
- After start cooking, the pot needs certain cooking timesteps to finish a food. Before the food is finished, players can choose to:
    - wait (probably not efficient)
    - Pick up the dish and wait to fill the cooked food in the dish.
    - Prepare for another cook cycle (especially if there is more than one pot in the environment).
- Once a ingredient is picked up, it can only be held by the player, placed in the pot (unless the pot is full), or placed on a counter. Similarly, once a dish is picked up, it can either be held by the player, filled with soup, or placed on a counter.
- One counter can place Only one item.
- There are many ways to synthesize AClemoncookedfish, for examples, pickup AClemon and place it on the counter table with dish and cookedfish, pickup cookedfish and place it on the counter table with dish and AClemon.
- Synthesis requires a plate as a medium; without a plate, synthesis cannot be performed. 
- Players cannot synthesize an item directly using objects held in their hands. For example, if Player 0 is holding cookedfish in dish and Player 1 is holding AClemon , one of the players must first place an item on the table, allowing the other player to perform the synthesis.
- if an order is avaliable in the kitchen, please deliver it at once. 

Skill: 
In this game, each player can ONLY perform the following 8 allowed skills: pickup, place_on_counter, put_raw_on_cutting_table, put_raw_in_pot, fill_dish_with, synthesize, deliver_order, wait. Do not attempt to use any other skills that are not listed here.
def pickup(obj):
    if object_in_hand() == "nothing": # hand holds nothing
        if obj in ["BClemon", "dish", "AClemon", "BCtomato"， "ACtomato", "rawbeef", "cookedfish", "cookedbeef", "cookedbeefhamburger", "ACtomatocookedbeefhamburger", "AClemoncookedfish"]:
            pass

def place_on_counter(obj):
    if object_in_hand() in ["BClemon", "dish", "AClemon", "BCtomato"， "ACtomato", "rawbeef", "cookedfish", "cookedbeef", "cookedbeefhamburger", "ACtomatocookedbeefhamburger", "AClemoncookedfish"]:
        pass

def put_raw_on_cutting_table(obj):
    if object_in_hand() in ["BClemon", "BCtomato"]:
        pass

def put_raw_in_pot(): # put one raw food in pot 
    if object_in_hand() in ["rawbeef", "rawfish"]:
        if pot_ingredient_count() == 1:
            pass

def fill_dish_with(obj):
    if object_in_hand() == "dish":
        if obj in ["AClemon", "ACtomato", "cookedfish", "cookedbeef", "cookedbeefhamburger", "ACtomatocookedbeefhamburger", "AClemoncookedfish"]:
            pass

def synthesize(obj):
    if obj in ["AClemoncookedfish"]
        if object_in_hand() == "cookedfish":
            pass
        elif object_in_hand() == "AClemon":
            pass

def deliver_order(order):
    if object_in_hand() in ["AClemoncookedfish"]:
        pass

def wait(num):  # wait positive num timesteps
    if type(num) == int and 0 < num <= 20:
        pass

Here are few examples:
<example>
H: Scene 0: Player 0 holds nothing. Player 1 holds nothing. Kitchen states: Pot is empty, cutting_table is empty. Current order is AClemoncookedfish and the remaining time is 198. 
A: Analysis: Pot is empty. Both Player 0 and Player 1 hold nothing and need to start preparing the ingredients. These two players should pickup rawfish.
Intention for Player 1: "pickup(rawfish)".
Plan for Player 0: "pickup(rawfish)".
</example>

<example> 
H: Scene 81: Player 0 holds nothing. Player 1 holds nothing. Kitchen states: Pot has 1 rawfish, cutting table is empty. Current order is AClemoncookedfish and the remaining time is 120. 
A: Analysis: The pot has a rawfish and both players are holding nothing. Player 1 should pick up an BClemon from the dispenser and put it on the cuttingtable to start cutting. Player 0 can wait for the cookedfish to be ready or pickup a dish from the dispenser to prepare for the next cooking cycle.
Intention for Player 1: "pickup(BClemon)".
Plan for Player 0: "wait(10)" or "pickup(dish)".
</example>

<example> 
H: Scene 42: Player 0 holds one rawfish. Player 1 holds one rawfish. Kitchen states: Pot is empty and need only one rawfish, cutting table is empty. Current order is AClemoncookedfish and the remaining time is 120. 
A: Analysis: The pot has is empty and need one rawfish to start cooking. Both Player 0 and Player 1 are holding a rawfish. Player 0 should put the rawfish in the pot and Player 1 should place the rawfish on the counter.
Intention for Player 1: "put_raw_in_pot()".
Plan for Player 0: "place_on_counter(rawfish)".
</example>

<exmaple> 
H: Scene 9: Player 0 holds one cookedfish. Player 1 holds one AClemon. Kitchen states: Pot is empty, cutting table is empty. Current order is AClemoncookedfish and the remaining time is 120. 
A: Analysis: Since Player 1 is holding the AClemon, he need place it on the counter. Player 0 can also place it on the counter. In the next few steps, Player0 should pickup dish and combine the AClemon and cookedfish to synthesize AClemoncookedfish. Player 1 can go on to pickup BClemon.
Intention for Player 1: "place_on_counter(AClemon)".
Plan for Player 0: "place_on_counter(cookedfish)".
</example>

<exmaple> 
H: Scene 39: Player 0 holds one dish. Player 1 holds one BClemon. Kitchen states: Pot is empty, AClemon in cutting_table is occupied, AClemoncookedfish is avaliable in the kitchen. Current order is AClemoncookedfish and the remaining time is 120. 
A: Analysis: Player 0 holds one dish, and Player 1 holds one BClemon. Player 0 should fill the dish with AClemoncookedfish, and then the cutting_table is occupied so that Player 1 should place the BClemon on one counter and to wait for the cutting_table is empty.
Intention for Player 1: "fill_dish_with(AClemoncookedfish)". 
Plan for Player 0: "place_on_counter(BClemon)".
</example>

<exmaple> 
H: Scene 45: Player 0 holds one AClemon in dish. Player 1 holds nothing. Kitchen states: Pot is empty, cutting_table is empty, There is cookedfish avaliable in the kitchen. Current order is AClemoncookedfish and the remaining time is 120. 
A: Analysis: Player 0 holds one AClemon in dish, and Player 1 holds nothing. Player 0 should combine the cookedfish and AClemon in hand to synthesize AClemoncookedfish, and Player 1 should pickup BClemon.
Intention for Player 1: "pickup(BClemon)". 
Plan for Player 0: "synthesize(AClemoncookedfish)".
</example>

<exmaple> 
H: Scene 66: Player 0 holds nothing. Player 1 holds nothing. Kitchen states: Pot is empty, cutting_table is empty, There are AClemon without dish, AClemoncookedfish in dish in the kitchen. Current order is AClemoncookedfish and the remaining time is 120. 
A: Analysis: Player 0 holds nothing, and Player 1 holds nothing. Player 0 should pickup AClemoncookedfish, and Player 1 should pickup rawfish.
Intention for Player 1: "pickup(rawfish)". 
Plan for Player 0: "pickup(AClemoncookedfish)".
