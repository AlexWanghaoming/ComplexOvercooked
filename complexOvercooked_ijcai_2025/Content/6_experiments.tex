We benchmark MARL algorithms in four customized \textit{ComplexOvercooked} layouts with increased difficulty (Figure \ref{fig:exp_layouts}): \textit{Supereasy}, \textit{2playerhard}, \textit{4playereasy}, \textit{4playersplit} (Figure\ref{fig:exp_layouts}). \textit{supereasy} is a layout with static objective (i.e.,  \textit{AClemoncookedfish}) that supports two players playing. \textit{2playerhard}, \textit{4playereasy} and \textit{4playersplit} support four types of orders (i.e., \textit{Cookedfish}, \textit{AClemoncookedfish}, \textit{Cookedbeefhamburger} and \textit{ACtomatocookedbeefhamburger}) among which two random orders will be generated simultaneously in the task menu every 200 timesteps. \\

\noindent\textbf{MARL algorithms} \ We use IPPO (independent PPO), VDN and IQL (independent Q-Learning) algorithms. The implementation of these algorithms can be referenced in \cite{papoudakis2020benchmarking}. Hyperparameters can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:hyper}. \\
\noindent\textbf{Training} \ In each layout, we train MARL agents for 2e7 steps and record average returns over 5 random seeds (Figure \ref{fig:training_curves}). From the training curves we can see that on-policy and off-policy algorithms can converge, but standard deviations seem to be large. In addition, when facing multiple objectives (i.e.,  Figure \ref{fig:training_curves}: b, c, d), the performance of the agents is suboptimal, and it is difficult for them to converge to an ideal reward.
